## Hi, I'm Ahmed👋
I build products that drive pipeline, revenue, and operational leverage.

My work sits at the intersection of Product Management, Growth, and AI transformation, translating ambiguous business problems into clear product strategy, structured roadmaps, and systems that scale.

I lead with product thinking.<br>
Define the problem. Validate with users. Prioritize for impact. Ship fast. Measure what matters.

Alongside that, I help companies embed AI into their workflows, designing automation systems, evaluating buy vs build decisions, and implementing AI agents that improve execution without adding complexity.

I don’t experiment for vanity.<br>
I build products that move metrics.

## What I Work On
### Product Management
<ul>
  <li>Problem framing and opportunity definition</li>
  <li>PRDs and structured execution workflows</li>
  <li>User research and insight synthesis</li>
  <li>Feature prioritization based on impact and business metrics</li>
  <li>Product-led growth experiments and iteration loops</li>
  <li>Revenue, retention, and unit economics alignment</li>
</ul>

### AI Transformation & Workflow Redesign
<ul>
  <li>AI readiness assessments and opportunity mapping</li>
  <li>Business case development for AI initiatives</li>
  <li>Buy vs build recommendations and vendor evaluation</li>
  <li>AI workflow redesign across revenue and operations</li>
  <li>Execution oversight from pilot to production</li>
  <li>Change management for AI adoption at scale</li>
</ul>

## My Approach
I operate at the intersection of product management, growth systems, and AI architecture.

I treat every initiative as a constrained optimization problem within a product lifecycle.

Product thinking comes first:
<ul>
<li>What user problem are we truly solving?</li>
<li>Where does this sit in the value chain?</li>
<li>What metric defines success at this stage of the product?</li>
<li>What trade-offs are we consciously making?</li>
</ul>

Then I design the system around it.

For every initiative, I map:
<ul>
<li>The core business constraint</li>
<li>The highest-leverage intervention point</li>
<li>The workflow layer that can be automated, augmented, or redesigned</li>
<li>The risk surface of AI integration</li>
</ul>

Before shipping, I pressure-test:
<ul>
<li>Are we solving root cause or automating symptoms?</li>
<li>Does this improve throughput, conversion, retention, or cost efficiency?</li>
<li>Is there a feedback loop and iteration cadence built in?</li>
<li>Can this scale without increasing operational entropy?</li>
</ul>

I don’t ship features. <br>
I manage products and architect systems that compound in impact over time.

## Currently Building
I’m currently working as a Product and Strategy Manager at a stealth edtech startup, where I focus on product direction, growth systems, and execution frameworks. My role involves translating market opportunities into structured roadmaps, validating user problems, and building scalable systems that align product outcomes with revenue goals.

Alongside this, I occasionally work with SMBs on AI transformation initiatives, helping them assess automation opportunities, redesign operational workflows, and implement practical AI systems that improve efficiency without adding unnecessary complexity.
